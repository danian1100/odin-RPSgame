This project consists on creating the popular game "Rock, Paper Scissors" in code, focusing in what was recently learned in Javascript.
It is played entirely in the console.

I will tackle some obvious problems when I touch on it again, but will only evolve the HTML and CSS after I choose my path.

With this project I've shown that I can use, create and name functions and variable, use loops, operators and conditionals and also that I can use the developers tools, mainly the console and source (debug) tabs.

With this new assignment the above-mentioned problems have disappeared. I learned how to branch and merge both in git has in the terminal. Regarding the project in itself I trained DOM manipulation.
